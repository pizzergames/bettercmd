# bettercmd

BetterCMD is a Program looking to Improve upon the Standart Windows console.
It features a better interface, a c compiler and so much more!

You can download the compiled version in the "exe" folder, and the source code in the "source" folder. 
Have fun!

INFO: The source code is made to run the commands as .exe files, and not as .py files. If you want to run the source code, the change it a little bit.

WHAT I'M WORKING ON:
    -I'm working on rewriting every command in the standart cmd "library"
    -Adding a brainfuck interpreter/compiler to the thing
