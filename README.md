# bettercmd

BetterCMD is a Program looking to Improve upon the Standart Windows console.
It features a better interface, a c compiler and so much more!

You can download the source code in the "source" folder.
Download the .exe at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFWe0ccRjXON2vxPl-oAIrgkwTYgv730/view?usp=share_link
Have fun!

INFO: The source code is made to run the commands as .exe files, and not as .py files. If you want to run the source code, the change it a little bit.

I'm currently working on rewriting every command in the cmd "library" in Python or C/C++
They are only in python for now, i wil rewrite most of the commands in C/C++, but that is not out yet.
